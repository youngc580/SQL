/* This is a coding social application data display case example.*/
/* The question presented was: What does the app's SQL look like? */
/* What was intended was to explore a small snippet of data, and then demonstrate use of (a) ALTER TABLE, (b) UPDATE, and (c) DELETE (a single row of data).*/
/* Output select statements were included so, upon executing a run of the code, the output tables would demonstrate the progression of the code objectives -- */
/* -- the most noticeable being where the SELECT statement pulled the tabled data after deleting a single row.*/
